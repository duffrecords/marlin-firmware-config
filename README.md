# marlin-firmware-config
backup of Marlin firmware configuration only

The Marlin firmware takes up a lot of space on disk and I don't update my 3D printer's firmware often enough to justify leaving it there.  This is a diff of the configuration changes to a particular tag, so I can download and rebuild it if necessary.
